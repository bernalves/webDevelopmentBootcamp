## Who am I

Hi! Happy to see you! Well, kind of.

I'm Bernardo and, believe it or not, I wasn't born a developer. I've got a thing about International Relations (that was my first bachelor of arts degree) and Software Engineering and I try to view things differently whenever I can. I hope my studies to be useful to you as well!

You can know more about me and checking out my profiles [on Github](https://github.com/bernalves) and [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santosalbirwt/). I'm glad for sharing this project with you, have a nice time!
